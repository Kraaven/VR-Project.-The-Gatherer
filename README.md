# The Gatherer

As part of the VR pathway course hosted on the Unity Learn Platform, i have to submit a project on whatever i learnt during that section of the course. This project is both an assignment and a personal creation.


## Note
- All the 3D models were made in Blender 3D
- This game will be all about gathering fruits on the trees and dropping them in the storage box to complete the gathering goal.
